Launcher3 is the default launcher in [AOSP Android](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3/), 
and is the base behind many customized launchers - even Google's own Now Launcher (obsolete) and Pixel Launcher.

My repo has [ore-m2-release ](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3/+/oreo-m2-release) [Launcher3](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3/) project branch
